1. The following data represents the number of absence of students.
	4 3 1 4 2 3 5 2 3 1 2 3 2 1 1 4 0 3 3 3
	 a. What is the type of our data? How many students are there in the survey (sample size)?
	   the type of our data is discrete. there are 20 students in the survey.
	 b. Construct frequency table and then construct increasing and decreasing cumulative                  frequency.6
	 c. Construct relative frequency and then construct relative increasing and relative decreasing         cumulative frequency.
	d. How many students are absent twice and corresponding to how many percentages?
		there are 4 students who absent twice. the percentage is 20%.
	e. How many students are absent at least twice and corresponding to how many percentages?
		there are 15 students who absent at least twice. the percentage is 75%.
	f. How many students are absent at most twice and corresponding to how many percentages?
		there are 9 students who absent at most twice. the percentage is 40%.
	g. What is the number of absences at which the frequency is highest and what is the number        of absences at which the frequency is lowest?
		the number of absent which the frequency is the highest is 3. and the lowest is 5. 
	h. Construct the bar and pie chart

	i. Calculate mode, median and give the interpretation of mean
		the mode is : 3
		median $LMe=\frac{n+1}{2}=10.5.\;so,\;Me=3$ 
		$mean,\;\bar{X}=\frac{\sum{(x_i)(f_i)}}{n}=\frac{(0)(1)+(1)(4)+(2)(4)+(3)(7)+(4)(3)+(5)(1)}{20}=2.5$
	
	j. Calculate mean deviation, variance and standard deviation.
		$Mean\,Deviation=\frac{\sum{f_i\;\left|\;x_i-\bar{X}\;\right|}}{n}=\frac{1\left|0-2.5\right|+4\left|1-2.5\right|+4\left|2-2.5\right|+7\left|3-2.5\right|+3\left|4-2.5\right|+1\left|5-2.5\right|}{20}=1.05$
		$variance\quad{s^2}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}f_i\,({x_i}-{\bar{X})^2}}{n-1}=\frac{1\,(0-2.5)^2+4\,(1-2.5)^2+4\,(2-2.5)^2+7\,(3-2.5)^2+3\,(4-2.5)^2+1\,(5-2.5)^2}{20-1}=1.4$
		$standard deviation\quad{s}=\sqrt{s^2}=\sqrt{1.4}=1.18$
