**Example1:** We want to compare students in class A and in Class B. We have the scores as following:

                        Class A: 5, 6, 4, 7, 8

                        Class B : 10, 7, 2, 9, 3
Which class is better? What indicators do you use in order to compare these two classes?
	to do this we have to calculate the mean of each class.
	formula Mean $\bar{X}=\frac{sumValueOfEverything}{n}$ 
	for class A : $\bar{X}=\frac{5+6+7+8+4}{5}=6.0$
	for class B : $\bar{X}=\frac{10,7,2,9,3}{5}=6.2$
	So, class B is better than class A.
**Example2:**

- Let variable X be the statistics score.

- We have data (realization of X: the students’ statistics score) as following:

     7          8          9          5          7          8          7          9          6          8           

-Questions:
	 a. Calculate the average score, then deduce the formula for mean, denoted by $\bar{X}$
	 b. Construct the frequency table.
	 c. From b., deduce the second formula for mean.
	d. Calculate the sum ![[Pasted image 20250511093946.png]] and then interpret the result. 
	e. Prove the result in d.
