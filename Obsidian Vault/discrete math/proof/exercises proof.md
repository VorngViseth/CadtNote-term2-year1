1. ***how that square of an even number is an even number using direct proof.*** 
	assume that $n=2k$ (even number form)
	$n^2=(2k)^2=4k^2=2(2k^2)$ 
	let $m=(2k^2)$ 
	so $n^2=2m$ (even number form), $n^2$ is an even number.
2. ***Show that the additive inverse, or negative, of an even number is an even
	number using a direct proof.***
	assume that $n=2k$ (even number form )
	now assume the additive inverse of n , $-n=-2k=2(-k)$ 
	let $-k=m$ 
	so $-n=2m$ (even number form)
	so, an negative of an even number is also an even number but negative.
3. ***Use a direct proof to show that if n is an odd number, then 5n+6 is odd.***
	assume that $n=2k+1$ (odd number form)
	then $5n+6=5(2k+1)+6=(10k+10)+1=2(5k+5)+1$ 
	let $m=5k+5$ 
	so $5n+6=2m+1$ (odd number form)
	so, $5n+6$ is an odd number if n is an odd number.
4. ***Prove that if m and n are integers and mn is even, then m is even or n is even.***
	assume $mn=2k$ (even number form)
	if m = a , n = b     a,b∈Z
	let $m=2k(even),n=2k+1(odd)$ 
	$mn=2k(2k+1)=4k^2+4k=2(2k^2+2k)$ 
	let $z=(2k^2+2k)$ 
	so $mn=2z$ (even form)
	so, mn is even weather m is even and n is odd or the other way around.
5. ***Prove that if n is an integer and 3n + 2 is even, then n is even ,using a proof
	by contrapositive.***
	contrapositive statement :
	$3n+2$ is even then n is even, $3n+2$ is odd then n is odd
	assume n is odd $n=2k+1$ 
	so : $3n+2=3(2k+1)+2=6k+5=2(2k+2)+1$
	let $m=2k+2$ 
	so $3n+2=2m+1$ , odd number
	so if n is an integer and $3n+2$ is even, then n is even. if it's odd then n is odd.
6. ***Prove that if n is a positive integer, then n is even if and only if 7n + 4 is even.***
	if n is even, then $7n+4$ is even
	if $7n+4$ is even then n is even
	 1. assume that  n is even $n=2k$ 
		so $7n+4=7(2k)+4=14k+4=2(7k+2)$
		let $m=7k+2$ 
		so $7n+4=2m$, $7n+4$ is divisible by 2 which is even number 
		so if n is even then $7n+4$ is even.
	2. $7n+4$ is even then n is even. so, if n is odd then $7n+4$ is odd
		assume that n is odd $n=2k+1$ 
		so $7n+4=7(2k+1)+4=14k+11=2(7k+5)+1$
		let $m=7k+5$ 
		so $7n+5=2m+1$ , which is clearly odd
		therefore, if n is odd then $7n+5$ is odd
		so, if $7n+5$ is even then n is even.
	since both direction are proven we conclude that n is even if and only if $7n+5$ is even.
7. ***Use a proof by contraposition to show that if 3nm+2 is irrational number, then
	m is irrational or n is irrational.***
	if $3mn+2$ is irrational number, then m is irrational or n is irrational. so, if $3mn+2$ is rational number, then both m n is rational
	assume that m is rational number : $m=\frac{a}{b}$ 
	assume that n is rational number :  $n=\frac{c}{d}$   , a,b,c,d ∈Z, b,d $\neq 0$ 
	$3mn+2=3\frac{ac}{bd}+2=\frac{3ac+2bd}{bd}$  $(r=\frac{q}{p})$
	so $3ac+2db$ is an integer number and $bd$ is a non zero integer. then $3mn+2$ is rational number.
	therefore, $3mn+2$ is irrational number, if m or n is irrational.
