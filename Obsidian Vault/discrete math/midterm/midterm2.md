# 2. a. Prove that n‚àà ‚Ñï, 1 + (‚àí1)ùëõ (2ùëõ ‚àí 1) is a multiple of 4?

assume that n is even : n = 2k 
$$1 + (-1)^{2k} \times [2(2k) - 1] = 1 + (4k - 1) = 4k $$
therefore, if n is even $1+(-1)^n(2n-1)$ is a multiple of 4.
assume that n is odd : n = 2k + 1
$$1 + (-1)^{2k+1}[2(2k+1) - 1] = 1 - (4k + 1) = -4k$$
therefore, if  n is odd then it is a multiple of 4.
# b. Solve that ‚àö11 is irrational number?
proof by contradiction 
assume that $\sqrt11$ is rational number = $r = \frac{q}{p}$
$\sqrt11 = \frac{p}{q}$
$11 = (\frac{p}{q})^2$
$p^2 = 11q^2$
if $p^2$ is divisible by 11, then p is divisible by 11.
assume that p = 11k
$(11k)^2 = 11q^2$
$q^2 = 11 k^2$
if $q^2$ is divisible by 11 then q is also divisible by 11
if p and q are divisible by 11 so it doesn't have lowest term.
therefore, $\sqrt11$ is irrational .
# 3. They given set ùê¥ = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. How many subset of A which has ( 3 points )
## i. 3 elements

subset of 3 elements of A = $$\frac{9!}{3!(9 - 3)!} = \frac{9\times8\times7}{3\times2\times1} = \frac{3\times4\times7}{1}= 84$$
therefore, there are 84 subsets of A 
## ii. 4 elements

subset of A of 4 elements = $$\frac{9!}{4!(9 - 4)!} = \frac{9\times8\times7\times6}{4\times3\times2\times1} = \frac{3\times7}{1}= 21$$
therefore , there are 21 subset of A of 4 elements .

## iii. 5 elements

subset of A of 5 elements = $$\frac{9!}{5!(9 - 5)!} = \frac{9\times8\times7\times6}{4\times3\times2\times1} = \frac{3\times7}{1}= 21$$
therefore, there are 21 subsets of A of 21 elements.

## iv. 6 elements

subset of A of 6 elements = $$\frac{9!}{6!(9 - 6)!} = \frac{9\times8\times7}{3\times2\times1} = \frac{3\times4\times7}{1}= 84$$
# 5. A group of students were surveyed, and it was found that each of the students were
surveyed likes at least one of the following three subjects :
Mathematics , Soft Skill and Algorithm.
( 5 points )
50 liked Mathematics
39 liked Soft Skill
39 liked Algorithm
21 liked Mathematics and Soft Skill
18 liked Mathematics and Algorithm
19 liked Soft Skill and Algorithm
22 exactly two of these subject ( Mathematics , Soft Skill and Algorithm )

find exactly two subject 
$(M \land S) + (M \land A) + (S \land A) - 3x = 21 + 18 + 19 - 3x$
$21 + 18 + 19 - 3x = 22$
$x = 12$
## a. How many students liked only Mathematics?
	$$
	\begin{align}
	only(M) = n(M) - n(M\land S) - n(M \land A) + all3 	
	\newline
	= 50 - 21 - 18 + 22
	\newline
	= 32
	\end{align}
	$$
	
b. How many students liked Soft Skill but not Mathematics or Algorithm?
c. How many students liked Algorithm but not Mathematics or Soft Skill?
d. How many students liked all of three ?
e. How many students liked Soft Skill and Algorithm but not Mathematics.
