### 1.Show that the square of an even number is an even number using a direct proof
assume that n is even 
let $n=2k$
$n^2=4k^2=2(2k^2)$ , $m=2k^2$
$so\;n^2=2m\quad{which\;is\;even.}$ 
therefore, the square of an even number is an even number.
### 2.Show that the additive inverse, or negative, of an even number is an even number using a direct proof.
assume that n is even
let $n=2k\quad{so,\;}-n=-2k=2(-k)$
let $m=-k\quad{}so,\;-n=2m$
which is even
therefore, inverse or negative of an even number is even number.
### 3.Use direct proof to show that if n is an odd number, then 5n+6 is odd.
assume that n is odd
let $n=2k+1$
so $5n+6=5(2k+1)+6=10k+11=2(5k+5)+1$let $m=5k+5$
$5n+6=2m+1$
which is odd.
therefore, if n is an odd number then 5n+6 is odd.
### 4.Prove that if m and n are integers and mn is even, then m is even or n is even.
assume that $mn\;is\;even=2k$
m = a and n = b; $a,b\in{Z}$
assume that n is even : $n=2k$
and m is odd $m=2k+1$
$mn=2k(2k+1)=4k^2+2k=2(2k^2+1)$
$let\;z=2k^2+1$
$so\;mn=2z$
which is even
therefore, if $m\;{}n$ is integer and $mn$ is even, then m is even or n is even.
### 5.Prove that if n is an integer and 3n + 2 is even, then n is even ,using a proof by contrapositive.
assume that $n\;is\;odd\;$
$so\;n=2k+1$
$3n+2=3(2k+1)+2=6k+5=2(3k+2)+1$
$let\;m=3k+2$
$so\;3n+2=2m+1$
which is odd
therefore, if n is an integer and 3n + 2 is even, then n is even. If it's odd then n is odd.
### 6.Prove that if n is a positive integer, then n is even if and only if 7n + 4 is even.
***integer n is even if and only if 7n + 4 is even.***
assume that n is even $n=2k$
$7n+4=7(2k)+4=14k+4=2(7k+2)$
let $z=7k+2$
so $7n+4=2z$
which is even.
 ***$7n+4$ is even if and only if n is even. if it's odd then n is odd***
assume that n is odd : $n=2k+1$
$7n+4=7(2k+1)+4=14k+11=2(7k+5)+1$
$let\;z=7k+5$
so $7n+4=2z+1$
which is odd 
therefore, integer n is even if and only if 7n + 4 is even.
### 7.Use a proof by contraposition to show that if 3nm+2 is irrational number, then m is irrational or n is irrational.
proof by contraposition : 
n and m have to be rational for 3mn + 2 is rational.
assume that n is rational : $n=\frac{a}{b}$
assume that m is rational : $m=\frac{c}{d}$ ; $a,b,c,d\;\in{Z};\;b,d\;\neq{0}$
$3mn+2=\frac{3ac+2bd}{bd}\quad{}(r=\frac{p}{q})$
so $3ac+2bd$ is integer number and b d is a non zero integer, so $\frac{3ac+2bd}{bd}$ is rational.
therefore, if 3mn + 2 is irrational, then m is irrational or n is irrational.
### 8.Solve that √7 is an irrational number
contradiction proof :
assume that $\sqrt{7}\;is\;rational$ 
$\sqrt{7}=\frac{a}{b}\quad(a,b\;are\;co-prime\;number,\;b\neq0)$
$7=(\frac{a}{b})^2$
$a^2=7b^2$ if $a^2$ is divisible by prime 7 then a is also divisible by prime 7.
so : $a=7k$ 
$(7k)^2=7b^2$
$49k^2=7b^2$
$b^2=7k^2$ if $b^2$ is divisible by 7 then b is also divisible by 7.
a and b are divisible by 7 so they are not lowest term.
therefore, $\sqrt7$ is irrational.
### 9.Use a proof by contraposition to show that if $a^2+b^2$ is odd, then a is even or b is even.
$a^2+b^2$ is odd then a is even or b is even
assume that $a^2+b^2$ is even then a and b is even.
assume that a is even : $a=2k$
assume that b is even : $b=2k$
$a^2+b^2=(2k)^2+(2k)^2=4k^2+4k^2=8k^2=2(4k^2)$
let $m=4k^2$
so $a^2+b^2=2m$
which is even, so $a^2+b^2$ is even if a and b is even.
therefore, $a^2+b^2$ is odd if a is even or b is even.
### 10.Use a proof by contraposition to show that if $𝑛^2+4𝑛+3$ is even, then n is odd.
$if\;n^2+4n+3$ is even then n is odd, so if n is even then $n^2+4n+3$ is odd 
assume that n is odd : $n=2k$
$n^2+4n+3=(2k)^2+4(2k)+3=4k^2+8k+3=2(2k^2+4k+1)+1$
let $m=2k^2+4k+1$
$n^2+4n+3=2m+1$
which is odd.
therefore,  so $n^2+4n+3$ is odd if n is even $n^2+4n+3$ is even if n is odd.
### 11.Prove that if n is a positive integer, then n is even if and only 7n+4 is even.
proof by contraposition :
assume that n is odd : $n=2k+1$
$7n+4=7(2k+1)+4=14k+7+4=2(7k+5)+1$
let $m=7k+5$
$7n+4=2m+1$
which is odd
assume that $7n+4$ is odd
$7n+4=2m+1$
$7n=2m-4+1=2(m-2)+1$
let $z=m-2$
$7n=2z+1$
which is odd.
therefore, n is even if and only if 7n+4 is even.
### 12.Use a proof by contraposition to show that if $4𝑛^2+𝑛−3$ is even, then n is odd
if n is even then $4n^2+n-3$ is odd.
assume that n is even : $n=2k$
$4n^2+n-3=4(2k)+2k-3=10k-3=2(5k-2)+1$
let $m=5k-2$
$4n^2+n-3=2m+1$
which is odd
therefore, if $4n^2+n-3$ is even then n is odd.
### 13.Prove that if n is an integer and 3n + 2 is even, then n is even using a proof by contradiction
