# I. In a group of 105 students
 70 students passed Math
60 students passed CCNA
45 students pass Advance Programing
30 students passed Math and CCNA
35 students passed CCNA and Advance Programing
25 students passed Math and Advance Programing 
15 passed all subject
Find the number of students who
a. Passed at least one subject?
b. Passed exactly two subject?
c. Passed Math and Failed CCNA
d. Passed all three subject that they passed two
e. Passed Math given that they passed CCNA

a. passed at least one subject 
	$(A\lor{C}\lor{M})=n(M)+n(A)+n(C)-n(M\land{C})-n(C\land{A}-n(M\land{A})+n(all)$ 
	$=70+60+45-30-35-25+15=100$
	there for there are 100 students who passed at least 1 subject.
b. passed exactly two subject
	$(M\land{C})=30-15=15$
