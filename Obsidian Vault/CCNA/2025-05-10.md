3. company has 6 departments IP : 172.21.0.0/16
	A, Calculate the subnet size
			Sale = 500 hosts  = $2^9$ = 512
			Management = 50 hosts =  $2^6$ = 64
			HR = 28 hosts = $2^5$ = 32
			Admin & Finance = 36 host = $2^6$ = 64
			Marketing = 300 = $2^9$ = 512
			IT = 10 hosts = $2^4$ =16
    B. Allocate the subnets for each department
		Sn1 = 172.21.0.0/25 for the Sale department
		Sn2 = 172.21.2.0/25 for the marketing department
		Sn3 = 172.21.4.0/25
			Sn3.1 = 172.21.4.0/26 for the Management department
			Sn3.2 = 172.21.4.64/26 for the Admin & Finance  department 
			Sn3.3 = 172.21.4.128/26
				Sn3.3.1 = 172.21.4.128/27 for the HR department
				Sn3.3.2 = 172.21.4.160/27
					Sn3.3.2.1 = 172.21.4.160/28 for the IT department
	C, Document the IP address range 
		Sale department : 172.21.0.1 - 172.21.0.127
		Marketing department : 172.21.2.1 - 172.21.3.254
		Management department : 172.21.4.1 - 172.21.4.63
		Admin & finance department : 172.21.4.65 - 172.21.4.127
		HR department : 172.21.4.129 - 172.21.4.159
		IT department : 172.21.4.161 - 172.21.4.175
4. IP address range 172.22.0.0/16, task is to create smaller subnets that can support a minimum of 1580 host addresses.
		A. How many subnets can you create from the given network at least 1580 each
			to create smaller subnets that can support up to 1580 hosts each we need to borrow 5 bits from the host portion. so, $2^5$ = 32 subnets. $2^{11}$ = 2048 -2 = 2046 hosts each.
		B. Determine the 1536th IPv4 address within the 18th subnet.
			Sn1 : 172.22.0.0/21
			Sn18 : 172.22.(18 - 1) * 8.0 = 172.22.136.0
			1536 / 256 = 6
			the 1536th IPv4 address within the 18th subnet is : 172.22.141.255/21
