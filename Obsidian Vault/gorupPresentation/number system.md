## **1. Applications of Number System in Real Life (Digital Fields)**

### 1. **Binary Number System in Programming**

- **Example:** All machine-level instructions in computers are written in binary (0s and 1s).
    
- **Explanation:** Computers use binary because digital electronics have two statesâ€”on and off. Every piece of code you write is eventually translated into binary.
    

### 2. **IP Addressing in Networking**

- **Example:** IPv4 uses a 32-bit binary address, such as `192.168.1.1`.
    
- **Explanation:** Routers and switches use binary to route data correctly across the internet.
    

### 3. **Digital Storage Calculation**

- **Example:** 1 kilobyte = 1024 bytes (based on binary powers).
    
- **Explanation:** File sizes and memory are calculated using binary multiples due to digital circuits.
    

### 4. **Color Codes in Digital Media**

- **Example:** Hexadecimal codes like `#FF5733` are used in HTML/CSS.
    
- **Explanation:** Colors in computer graphics are often represented using hexadecimal numbers, which are compact forms of binary.
    

### 5. **Barcode and QR Code Encoding**

- **Example:** A barcode uses binary to encode product information.
    
- **Explanation:** These codes are scanned and converted into binary numbers that identify items in e-commerce systems.
