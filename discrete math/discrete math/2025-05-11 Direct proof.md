direct proof shows that a conditional statement p -> q is true by showing that if p is true then q must also be true so that the combination of p true and q false will never occur. 
1. ***Even and Odd number 
	1. even number n = 2k
	2. odd number n = 2k + 1
		### ***Example**
		if n is odd, then $n^2$ is odd.
		. Assume that n = 2k + 1 (odd form)
		. $n^2$ = $(2k + 1)^2$  = $4k^2+4k+1$ = $2(2k^2+2k)+1$ 
		. let $m=(2k^2+2k)$ 
		. so $n^2=2m+1$, so $n^2$ is an odd integer. 
		### ***Example***
		if n is even, then $n^2$ is even.
		Assume that n = 2k (even form)
		$n^2=(2k)^2=4k^2=2(2k^2)$ 
		let $m=2k^2$ 
		so $n^2=2m$ , so $n^2$ is an even integer.
2. ***parity*** 
		parity refers to weather an integer is even or odd
			. if the number is even(n = 2k), it has even parity 
			. if the number is odd(n = 2k + 1), it has odd parity
		***parity comparison***
		**. same parity** : two numbers are both even or odd.
		**. different parity** : one number is even and other is odd.
		
	***Example*** 
		if two integers have the same parity, then their sum is even.
		**case 1**
		both number is even 
		let a = 2m and b = 2n, where  m,n∈Z
		their sum is a + b = 2m + 2n = 2(m + n)
		since m, n is an integer so a + b is divisible by 2.
		**case 2** 
		both integer are odd
		let a = 2m + 1 and b = 2n + 1, where m,n∈Z
		their sum is a + b = 2m + 1 + 2n + 1 = 2(m + n + 1)
		since m,n is an integer so a + b is divisible by 2.
		
	***Example***		
		if two integers have different parity, then their sum is odd.
		let's suppose 
		a is even a = 2n
		b is odd b = 2m + 1, m,n∈Z
		sum a + b = 2n + 2m + 1 = 2(m + n) + 1 
		let k = m +  n
		-> a + b = 2k + 1, is a form of an odd number.
		so two integers that have different parity, then the result is odd.
3. ***Rational and Irrational number***
	1. **Rational number**
		is any real number that can express as a fraction  $r=\frac{p}{q}$ and can write as $\frac{1}{2}$ = 0.5
	2. **Irrational number**
		is the number that can't write as fraction of two integer :
			. the fraction can go on forever and not in the same loop(not repeat in patterns) like $\pi$
